# Human-behavior-recognition-based-on-multi-scale-convolutional-neural-network
📌 Overview

This project presents a deep learning–based approach for recognizing and classifying human actions from video data using a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model captures both spatial (appearance) and temporal (motion) features to accurately identify human behaviors.

⚙️ Approach

Video frame extraction and preprocessing
Multiscale CNN for learning fine and coarse features
Space-time feature extraction to model motion patterns
Optimized convolution layers for faster and compact execution

🛠️ Technologies

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
NumPy

✨ Features

Accurate human behavior classification
Efficient and optimized CNN architecture
Suitable for real-time and scalable applications

🚀 Usage
git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-behaviour-recognition.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py

🔮 Future Scope

Integrate LSTM / Transformer for enhanced temporal learning

Extend to real-time surveillance and activity monitoring
